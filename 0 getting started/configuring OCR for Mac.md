## Configuring OCR for Mac

- open the terminal (spotlight search 'terminal')
- Assuming you have homebrew installed, type `brew install tesseract`
- And you're done. See [[how to ocr an image]]

If you don't have homebrew installed, you can install it by entering at the terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

But always check here first: [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

...and then once it's installed, `brew install tesseract`
