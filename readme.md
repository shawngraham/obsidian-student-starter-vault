Download, then unzip this folder.

Start Obsidian, 'open new vault', and select this folder

When the warning popup about community plugins & safe mode appears, turn safe mode OFF 

If you're not familiar with obsidian, try opening the 'help/demo' vault that comes bundled with obsidian, make some notes in there, so that you get the hang of things. Pay attention to the tour of the interface, plus how to open multiple notes and rearrange panes before jumping too far into _this_ vault.

Check out [[On Taking Notes]] to get started with the various functions in this vault. These include:

- ocr templater extracts text from images and inserts into a new note
- extract notes from hypothesis
- citations from zotero bib
- with mdnotes installed in zoter, you can export your zotero notes to this vault
- with refactor commands, you can break big notes into atomic notes
- with the 'related' templater, you can use text analysis to find notes that are similar, to enable linking
- open the backlink pane, and use backlinks and outgoing links to find potential connections with other notes (compares the text of the note to the title of notes, finding matching strings for potential linking)
- use the journey plugin to find paths through the vault, chains of ideas; these chains can be inserted into new notes
- use transclusion (embedding) to create long overview notes that pull your ideas/observations from atomic notes into something that can become the core for a paper or article
- queries to see how long you've got left for a writing project, and to see which resources you've used for what project
- kanban boards for project management

The folder [0 getting started] contains information on the various features that are installed, and guidance as necessary.

I think that's it!
